# ooops-ui

Accessible, design-neutral UI behavior with framework adapters. The monorepo keeps interaction logic in one framework-agnostic source of truth and exposes progressively enhanced Astro 7 and reactive Svelte 5 components.

## Packages

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@ooopsstudio/ui-primitives` | Form validation, controls, collections, navigation, layers and the canonical accessibility focus trap. |
| `@ooopsstudio/ui-editor-manifests` | Optional editor adapter metadata for UI components and interactive scenes. |
| `@ooopsstudio/ui-astro` | Astro 7 markup and progressive-enhancement adapters. |
| `@ooopsstudio/ui-svelte` | Svelte 5 components backed by the same controllers. |
| `@ooopsstudio/scene-core` | Renderer-neutral scene lifecycle, scheduling, interaction modes and resource admission. |
| `@ooopsstudio/scene-three` | Three.js WebGPU/WebGL 2 runtime, asset loading and resource ownership. |
| `@ooopsstudio/scene-astro` | Accessible Astro scene markup, explicit registries and view-transition lifecycle. |

All styling is optional. Components expose stable `data-part` and state attributes so each product can own its visual design.

The component set includes Field, Input, Textarea, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Select, Combobox, MultiSelect, DropdownMenu, Tooltip, Tabs, Accordion, Slider, NumberInput, SegmentedControl, Dialog, Modal and Popover. Behavior lives once in primitives; Astro and Svelte only adapt markup and lifecycle.

## Requirements

- Node 22.14.0 or newer
- pnpm 11.13.0

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm -w validate
```

Use Changesets for versioning and releases. Packages are public and publish to npm under the `@ooopsstudio` scope.

## Workspace contract

The root workspace orchestrates packages. Packages own their own tool choices.

Required package scripts:

- `typecheck`
- `build`

Optional package scripts:

- `test`
- `size`
- `publint`
- `attw`

That means the root contract scales without assuming that every package has one entrypoint, one export map shape, or one publish profile.

## What’s inside

- Shared TypeScript base config
- Shared ESLint flat config
- Shared Vitest base config for package-local merges
- Generic dependency-cruiser baseline
- Local CI and release workflows
- Template guard for unreplaced publish-facing placeholders
- Seven core UI/scene packages plus an optional visual-editor manifest adapter
- Non-workspace archetype examples for more advanced package shapes

## UI test layers

The repository keeps complementary validation layers:

- **Unit tests** validate controller state, hostile input handling and framework adapter rendering contracts.
- **Primitive browser tests** exercise the headless controllers directly against explicit DOM fixtures.
- **Adapter E2E tests** consume built package exports from real Astro 7 and SvelteKit 2 applications. They cover progressive enhancement, SSR hydration, bindings, snippets, portals, focus, view transitions, cleanup and axe accessibility checks.
- **Model/property tests** use fast-check to exercise random state transitions, geometry and value sequences.
- **Mutation tests** verify that primitives tests fail when Stryker changes meaningful behavior.
- **Visual and stress tests** cover responsive/RTL/accessibility rendering plus 100 repeated lifecycle cycles.
- **Manual assistive-technology tests** cover VoiceOver/Safari and NVDA/Firefox/Chrome announcements using `docs/assistive-technology-testing.md`.

Chromium runs the complete component matrix. Firefox and WebKit run the critical keyboard, form, focus, layer and lifecycle flows. Browser, visual and stress tests are blocking in CI and release validation, but remain outside the faster everyday `pnpm validate` command. Mutation testing runs on its dedicated scheduled/manual workflow. Manual AT results must be recorded separately and are never inferred from axe.

Filter by package: `pnpm -w -F @your-scope/<pkg> <script>`

## Package archetypes

The template supports four generic package shapes without making the repo domain-specific:

- **Public package**: publishable single-entry library. See `packages/ui-primitives/` and `examples/package-archetypes/public-package/`.
- **Private workspace package**: internal support code that participates in required checks but omits publish-oriented scripts. See `examples/package-archetypes/private-workspace/`.
- **Multi-entry package**: one package with multiple public subpaths and package-local entry mapping. See `examples/package-archetypes/multi-entry-package/`.
- **Adapter package**: publishable package with peer dependencies and package-local overrides. See `examples/package-archetypes/adapter-package/`.

These examples are intentionally not part of the workspace. They document supported expansion paths without forcing those shapes into every generated repo.

## Shared defaults and package-local overrides

The root configs are shared defaults, not rigid rules.

Use package-local config when a package needs to diverge:

- **Vitest**: create `packages/<name>/vitest.config.ts` and merge from the root base.
- **tsup**: keep build entry maps in `packages/<name>/tsup.config.ts`.
- **size-limit**: use `.json` for simple packages and `.mjs` when the config needs logic or multiple budgets.
- **peer dependencies**: declare them only in the packages that need adapter-style host integration.
- **dependency-cruiser layering**: extend the generic baseline with repo-specific import rules when your package graph needs stricter architecture enforcement.

## Publish safety checks

The template includes two generic publish-oriented checks beyond `publint` and `attw`:

- **Manifest policy** checks package metadata for publishable packages:
  - `license`
  - `repository`
  - `homepage`
  - `bugs.url`
  - `engines.node`
  - `files`
  - `exports`
  - `publishConfig.access` for scoped public packages
- **Packed artifact smoke test** verifies the actual tarball:
  - `pnpm pack` succeeds
  - the tarball contains built files under `dist/`
  - the tarball omits `src/`, `test/`, and `coverage/`
  - a temp consumer can install the tarball
  - Node can import every exported specifier
  - TypeScript can resolve every exported specifier

## When to override root defaults

Stay with the root defaults when the package is a straightforward library.

Override locally when the package has one of these traits:

- multiple public subpath exports
- browser vs server entrypoints
- peer dependencies
- special size budgets
- stricter or package-specific test setup
- custom dependency-layering rules

The root should stay orchestration-only. Package-specific complexity should stay package-local.

## Adding a new package

Start with the minimum package interface:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit",
    "build": "tsup"
  }
}
```

Then add optional scripts only if the package needs them:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "size": "size-limit --config .size-limit.json",
    "publint": "publint",
    "attw": "attw --pack --ignore-rules no-resolution --ignore-rules cjs-resolves-to-esm"
  }
}
```

Use the archetype examples when choosing a package shape instead of copying the demo package blindly.

## Optional tooling installer

This repository was generated from a mandatory core plus optional tooling modules. Re-run `pnpm init:template -- --dry-run` to preview changes before reconfiguring the template.

Registry strategy: `npm`

Enabled module state:

- `dependency-cruiser` — enabled; Dependency graph architecture checks.
- `license-policy` — enabled; Dependency license policy, checker script, and schema.
- `migration-tools` — enabled; Scripts for creating packages and copying packages from another monorepo.
- `package-readiness` — enabled; Advisory or strict release-readiness reports for publishable packages.
- `publint-attw` — enabled; publint and Are The Types Wrong package compatibility checks.
- `registry-github` — disabled; Optional GitHub Packages publishing and consumer registry documentation.
- `release` — enabled; Changesets release workflow, publish preflight, and release documentation.
- `renovate` — enabled; Weekly dependency update automation for npm, pnpm lockfile, and GitHub Actions.
- `security-audit` — enabled; Production and development dependency audit scripts and CI jobs.
- `size-limit` — enabled; Package-level size-limit scripts, configs, and dev dependencies.

Disabled modules are removed by default from scripts, workflows, docs and files. Use `--no-cleanup` when you want to leave optional source files in place for later.

## Dependency automation

Renovate is enabled by default for this generated repository. It runs weekly for npm/pnpm dependencies, lockfile maintenance, and GitHub Actions updates. Automerge is disabled so maintainers review updates before merging.

## Security checks

- `pnpm -w audit:prod` blocks CI on production advisories at `moderate` or higher.
- `pnpm -w audit:dev` blocks CI for development dependency advisories.
- `pnpm -w check:licenses` blocks validation when installed packages use licenses outside `license-policy.json`.

## Release safety

Release supports classic `NPM_TOKEN` and npm trusted publishing for npm, plus GitHub Packages publishing when the registry strategy is `github` or `both`. Before publishing, `pnpm -w release:preflight` verifies that the required credentials for `npm` are present. The release workflow also supports manual `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run=true` for validation without publishing.

Recommended branch protection:

- Protect `main`.
- Require CI to pass before merge.
- Require review for release PRs generated by Changesets.
- Disable direct pushes to `main`.

## Package readiness

Package readiness is enabled as a strict release gate. It summarizes package metadata, docs, export surface, packed size, quality scripts, changeset state and public-facing leakage warnings.

```sh
pnpm -w readiness
pnpm -w readiness:json
pnpm -w readiness:strict
```

Use `package-readiness.config.json` to adjust thresholds for large intentional packages, for example service suites with many public subpaths.

## For internal package splits

This template can extract reusable packages from larger monorepos into focused package repos, for example `ooops-suite` to `ooops-cms-packages` or `ooops-analytics-packages`.

```sh
pnpm -w copy:package -- --from ../ooops-cms-packages/packages/cms-api
pnpm -w create:package -- --name @your-scope/new-package --archetype public-package
pnpm -w deprecate:package -- --package @your-scope/old-package
```

Migration scripts support dry-run behavior and never commit changes. The deprecation helper is dry-run by default and only calls `npm deprecate` when `--execute` is passed.

## CI and release

The bundled GitHub Actions workflows are local to the repository.

- CI uses `pnpm -w validate:ci`, which is template-aware:
  - before bootstrap it runs a template-safe profile so the fresh template repo stays green
  - after bootstrap it automatically runs the full `pnpm -w validate` pipeline
- CI also runs `pnpm -w audit:prod` as blocking and `pnpm -w audit:dev` as blocking.
- Release stays strict and always uses `pnpm -w validate:release`, including the adapter browser matrix.
- CI reports primitives, Astro and Svelte browser projects separately and uploads traces, screenshots and videos after failures.
- Release runs `pnpm -w release:preflight` before publish and supports manual dry-run validation through `workflow_dispatch`.
- Package publishing uses registry strategy `npm`.

## Troubleshooting

- **“I want the shortest possible onboarding path.”**
  Run `pnpm bootstrap`. It installs dependencies, infers defaults from git and the current folder name when possible, then runs the same bootstrap flow as `pnpm init:template`.

- **“I want to bootstrap the generated repo without editing files manually.”**
  Run `pnpm init:template`. It prompts for scope, repository, package names, and starter package directory, and it can run non-interactively with flags or preview changes with `--dry-run`.

- **“Install warned that build scripts were ignored.”**
  Run `pnpm approve-builds` and approve the packages your environment needs, or configure pnpm’s build-script policy for CI and local development.

- **“validate fails immediately with placeholder errors.”**
  Replace the placeholder values in the manifest files called out by `pnpm -w guard:template`.

- **“GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests.”**
  Add a PAT with `repo` scope as `RELEASE_TOKEN`. The bundled release workflow already prefers it over the default `github.token`.

- **“A package needs more complex config than the demo package.”**
  Use one of the archetype examples under `examples/package-archetypes/` and keep the extra complexity inside that package.
